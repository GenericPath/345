COSC 345 project

I'm currently using https://online.officetimeline.com to make the chart - it's quite bad so if you find any alternatives please let me know.
They put a watermark on the PNG file but if you download it as a *transperent* PNG then you can just use GIMP's (or equivelent) "select by colour tool" to remove it.
I just upload the spreadsheet edit then download as they don't let you save without an account.
